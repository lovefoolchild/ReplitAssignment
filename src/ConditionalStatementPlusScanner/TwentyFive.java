/* For you to do:
    The variable "num" holds an integer input from a user
    Write a conditional statement starting on line 9 that does the following:
    - If num is positive, print "__ is positive"
    - If num is negative, print "__ is negative"
    - If num is equals to 0, then print "Entered number is equals to 0"

    Examples:
    In: 5
    5 is positive
    In: -2
    -2 is negative
    In: 0
    Entered number is equals to 0
